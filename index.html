<p>Hello! 
  My name is Dominique Villasenor and I am a recent graduate from the University of California, Riverside.
  I am 24 years old. I was born and raised in Stockton, CA. I was a delegate for ASUCR’s Student Voice Committee 
  and the president of the California Health Professional Student Alliance Chapter at UCR. As a first generation 
  transfer student and a neuroscience major, I am interested in understanding the biological mechanisms of brain 
  diseases and how it affects low income individual’s ability to access healthcare. I am a strong advocate for a 
  universal healthcare system and aim to change our policy in healthcare. I plan to pursue a career in neuroscience 
  and public policy by applying to a graduate program.</p>

<p>Fun Fact: I have always had a passion for swimming and the first job that I ever had was lifeguarding. I continued
  this passion by working as a lifeguard during my time as a UCR student.</p>
